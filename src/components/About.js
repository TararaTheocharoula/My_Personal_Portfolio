    <p>I am Front-end developer and the last 7 Years i live in Athens.<br/>
       I am from Thessaloniki and i have a little daughet, her name is Ioanna.<br/>
       In 2018 I completed my undergraduate studies in Information Technology <br/> 
       in the city of Kastoria and in 2023 my master's degree in advanced<br/> 
       IT systems - software development and artificial intelligence at the <br/>
